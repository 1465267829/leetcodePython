Top K



Problem Statement:



You are given an array of integers arr, of size n, which is analogous to a continuous stream of integers input. Your task is to find K largest elements from a given stream of numbers.

By definition, we don't know the size of the input stream. Hence, produce K largest elements seen so far, at any given time. For repeated numbers, return them only once.



If there are less than K distinct elements in arr, return all of them.



Note:

Don't rely on size of input array arr.
Feel free to use built-in functions if you need a specific data-structure.


Input/Output Format For The Function:



Input Format:



There is only one argument: Integer array arr.



Output Format:



Return an integer array res, containing K largest elements. If there are less than K unique elements, return all of them.

Order of elements in res does not matter.



Input/Output Format For The Custom Input:



Input Format:



The first line of input should contain an integer n, denoting size of input array arr. In next n lines, ith line should contain an integer arr[i], denoting a value at index i of arr.

In the next line, there should be an integer, denoting value of K.



If n = 5, arr = [1, 5, 4, 4, 2] and K = 2, then input should be:



5

1

5

4

4

2

2



Output Format:



Letâ€™s denote size of res as m, where res is the array of integers returned by solution function.

Then, there will be m lines of output, where ith line contains an integer res[i], denoting value at index i of res.



For input n = 5, arr = [1, 5, 4, 4, 2] and K = 2, output will be:



4

5



Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= K <= 10^5
arr may contains duplicate numbers.
arr may or may not be sorted


Sample Test Case:



Sample Test Case 1:



Sample Input 1:



arr = [1, 5, 4, 4, 2]; K = 2



Sample Output 1:



[4, 5]



Sample Test Case 2:



Sample Input 2:



arr = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]; K = 3



Sample Output 2:



[5, 1]
